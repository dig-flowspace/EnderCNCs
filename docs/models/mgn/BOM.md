!!! Note
    You can re-use 2 belt lengths from the Ender 3, but you still need one more ~350mm length. 

!!! Tip
    You can re-use 3 limit switches from the Ender 3, if you want to cut them off the PCB's but you'll still be missing 1, so you need to order AT LEAST 1 more, it is probably easier just to buy a new set if you go with this option. The recommendation is to go with the endstop mod.

 Adapted for 350MM MGN Rails
- Adjusted Rail Positioning
- Shuffled End-stops location to reflect changes made to carriages.
- Added Addition End-Stop locations for boards that support it.
- Two threaded nuts per Axis with both 3mm and threaded inset options on all axis.
- Moved X Axis cable chain to allow for a mounting position on the Y gantry.
- Measurements were confirmed with data/spec sheets and referenced the original E3CNC CAD for tolerances.
- Moved Z Axis forward 2mm (to compensate for Z Axis threaded rod connection change, needed extending backwards by 2mm).
- Updated 52mm and 65mm 3D printed Spindle mounts to match New Z Axis Position.
- Updated 52MM Spindle clamp mount (for the metal clamp that comes with many 52mm Spindles and spindle kits).
- Added Subframe support and work holding options (will require extra extrusion. 1x 400mm 4020 cut to length (~360mm) and 2x 300mm 4020 can be left at 300mm).
- Includes some test 3D prints for spacing and sizing of MGN12 carriages, vertical and horizontal holes, threaded rod connections, and Z carriage rail spacing for the main X extrusion.
- Added alternative Y/Y1 Gantry pieces that lower the print time by a smidgen.
- Added alternative front corner blocks for 360MM rails.
